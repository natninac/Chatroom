## Chatroom Project Prototype

This is our Chatroom prototype for CART 263. It has yet to be implemented as an online space, but it functions with local servers. 
Users can modify placements of the main windows, as well as explore a 3D environment inspired by the metro. 
They can also create usernames and change them anytime, which will display when they submit messages on the chatroom.
